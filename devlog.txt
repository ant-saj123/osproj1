Day 1: Initial Setup (Logger Basics)
Progress:
- Created the initial structure for the logger module.
- Implemented basic logging functionality that appends messages to a file.

Challenges:
- Decided on using `sys.stdin` to read messages and `time.strftime` for timestamps.

Next Steps:
- Improve the log format by including action tags (e.g., "INFO", "ERROR").
- Start working on the encryptor module.


Day 2: Logger Improvements & Encryptor Setup

Progress:
- Enhanced the logger by adding action tags (e.g., "INFO", "ERROR") for log messages.
- Created the basic structure for the encryptor module.

Challenges:
- Figured out how to handle different log message types with the logger.

Next Steps:
- Implement  cipher encryption logic.
- Start working on encryption and decryption functionality in the encryptor.
