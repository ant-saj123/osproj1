Day 1: Initial Setup (Logger Basics)
Progress:
- Created the initial structure for the logger module.
- Implemented basic logging functionality that appends messages to a file.

Challenges:
- Decided on using `sys.stdin` to read messages and `time.strftime` for timestamps.

Next Steps:
- Improve the log format by including action tags (e.g., "INFO", "ERROR").
- Start working on the encryptor module.
